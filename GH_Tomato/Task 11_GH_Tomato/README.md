The dataset contains 2 tables:

Greenhouse 181C Environmental data: time series data at 5-minute granularity
  Both light and CO2 enrichment in greenhouse 181C
Greenhouse 181E Environmental data: time series data at 5-minute granularity
  Light supplementation with ambient CO2 conditions in greenhouse 181E

Variable Definitions:

Climate Temperature in degrees Fahrenheit
Light Bench State (1,2,3 benches) represented by percentage. 100% indicates lights are fully on. 0% indicates lights are off.
Shade Roof represented by percentage of position. 100% indicates shade curtain fully retracted (open). 0% indicates shade curtain fully closed.
PAD Vent Shutter Current Timed Position represented by percentage. 0% indicates vents fully closed. 100% indicates vents fully open.
Exhaust Fans VFD Current Timed Position represented by percentage. 0% indicates fans are off. 100% indicates fans are fully on.
PPF or inside photosynthetic photon flux density in micromols per second. Recorded using Licor sensors.
DLI or daily light integral in moles per meter squared per day (mol/m^2*d).
Only in GH_181C: CO2 reading in parts per million (ppm).
